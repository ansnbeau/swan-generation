Swan is a synchronous, typed data-flow language used to define operators (either a node or a function) with explicit inputs/outputs and equations. A module can contain type/const/sensor declarations and user-defined operators whose signatures look like:

«The next user message will describe the operator to write (kind, names, types, and behavior). Produce only the Swan code in the subset above.»
